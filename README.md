"The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman has original examples in Javascript using the Processing-based p5.js environment. Here, the examples will be created in python using the py5 package that emulates how Processing handles graphics and animation. Java 17+ is required for the py5 package to work. Note that these are the examples, not the exercises in the book. Examples are used to confirm output and the "correct answer," which is needed to verify correct functionality when converting from javascript to python.
